            <li>It is tradition to where black on opening night because when a show opens the performers mourn the act of creating something new. They are now just recreating the thing they have already created. </li>
            <li>Theatre as we know it today originates from an Ancient Greek religious ceremony called "dithyamb" in which a group of men dressed up in goatskins</li>
            <li>The area of the theatre where the audience sits is reffered to as "the house"</li>
            <li>Theatre people are very superstititious. One of the most famous superstitions in theatre is that of Macbeth. If a person utters the name of Shakespeare's Scottish play in a theatre they must leave the theatre, spin around, and spit over their shoulder three times. If they do not then legend has it, the show will go horribly wrong.</li>
            <li>The word theatre comes from the greek verb meaning "to behold"</li>
            <li> The longest running show on broadway is <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> which opened its doors in 1988</li>
            <li>It is a famous belief among thespians that if you have a bad dress rehearsal you are sure to have a good opening night (I can attest to this one)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite aftershow rituals is the ghost light. When work is done in the theatre for the day all the memembers of the company gather around a light in the middle of the stage and recite the epilogue from mid summers nught dream saying "If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumbered here, whilst these visions did appear" After that is said they then turn on the light saying good night ghosts. This is done to thank the ghosts for letting the company use the space to create art</li>
            <li> It is a common belief that all theatres are haunted</li>
            <li>It is considered bad luck for a company to block their curtain call before dress rehearsal. Many dress rehearsals are open to the public and thespians believe that no show is complete without an audience.</li></ol>
